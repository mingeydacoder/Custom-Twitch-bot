# Custom-Twitch-bot
This is a program that allows you create a bot (or combine your own account) in chat to help moderating a stream. Existing twitch bot such as Streambot or Nightbot may not able to fulfill some detailed request or complete complicated tasks. For example, if you want to timeout some guy who spam the chat for typing over 3 lines consecutively, Nightbot might not come in handy. Another reason for using a custom bot is, if you are just a moderator of a channel, but you still want to keep the chat organized automatically without messing with the channel's Nightbot settings, then here you go! With Python scripts you can almost do anything to make the chat behave.
